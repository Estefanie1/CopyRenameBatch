# CopyRenameBatch

*Copying files from one folder to another and renaming them at the same time*


Using **Notepad** you can move files from one folder to another and rename them all in one step.  

1) Locate the file path location of the file(s) that you want to copy

2) Locate the file path location of where you want to place those file(s)

3) Using the copy command set them up as 

          **copy "Y:\FolderA" "C:\FolderB"**
 
 Or 
 
 If you just want to copy a specific file specify the name and the type of file
 
         **copy "Y:\FolderA\file.pdf" "C:\FolderB"**
  
  4) To rename use the new file location and specify the file and the new name next to it
  
          **rename "C:\FolderB\file.pdf" fileA.pdf**
 
***Done!***
